Ranges/Bins and Groupby
#Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 
#Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
#Average Math Score
#Average Reading Score
#% Passing Math
#% Passing Reading
#Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

#Perform the same operations as above, based on school size.
